Change is a constant companion in life, and I've recently made some big decisions that are shaping my journey in exciting ways. Let me share what's been happening.

#### Leaving AppOmni

After almost five years at AppOmni, I've decided to move on. It was a great experience, filled with learning and growth. But sometimes, you need to follow your gut and take the leap into the unknown. It's a bit like jumping off a cliff, hoping your parachute opens. Exciting, right?

#### Diving into Bug Bounty Full-Time

I've always had a passion for bug bounty hunting. It's like a treasure hunt, but instead of gold, you're finding vulnerabilities. Now, I'm dedicating myself to this pursuit full-time. It's a thrilling world where every day is a new challenge, and the rewards are as satisfying as finding that last piece of the puzzle.

#### Solo Founder & Entrepreneur

In addition to bug bounty, I'm stepping into the shoes of a solo founder and entrepreneur. Building something from scratch is both daunting and exhilarating. It's about creating value and solving problems, and I can't wait to see where this path leads.

#### AI App Builder

Technology is evolving rapidly, and AI is at the forefront. I'm diving into AI app building, leveraging cutting-edge tools to create solutions that can make a real impact. It's an awesome field, and I'm excited to be a part of it.

#### Co-hosting the Critical Thinking Bug Bounty Podcast

On top of everything, I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be co-hosting the Critical Thinking Bug Bounty podcast. It's a platform where we delve into the nuances of bug bounty hunting, share insights, and hopefully, inspire others to join this fascinating field.

### Final Thoughts

Life is about embracing change and taking risks. Whether it's leaving a job, starting a new venture, or exploring a passion, each step is a chance to learn and grow. Here's to new adventures and the countless possibilities they bring!
