### What is High Agency?

Ever found yourself stuck in a tricky situation and thought, "Who would I call to get me out of this?" That person you just thought of—that's someone with high agency. It's an elusive quality that's hard to define but easy to recognize. Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

### Spotting High Agency People

High agency individuals stand out because they:

- Have weird teenage hobbies (going against the grain early).
- Energize you, even when you're exhausted.
- Defy stereotypes (think: a boxer writing poetry).
- Move far from home, embracing new challenges.
- Share niche, insightful content without caring about popularity.
- Are honest to your face and supportive behind your back.
- Quit prestigious roles to follow their passion.
- Verify information independently, refusing to accept "common knowledge."
- Teach themselves new skills, from music to complex tech.
- Question the very questions posed to them.

### The High Agency Spectrum

High agency isn't about optimism or pessimism—it's about seeing yourself as a tap, able to fill your own glass. It's about shaping the future actively, not passively accepting what's handed to you.

### High Agency Software: Five Key Principles

1. **No Unsolvable Problem:** If it doesn't defy physics, it's solvable. Remember, Claude Shannon and Ed Thorp hacked roulette with a wearable computer—because they believed it was possible.

2. **No Single Way:** Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer each warmed up differently, yet all achieved greatness. Find your unique approach.

3. **No Adults:** Your heroes are human too. Steve Jobs delayed cancer treatment for carrot juice; Mozart was buried in debt. Don't idolize—humanize.

4. **No Normal:** Normal is forgettable. Embrace your weirdness; it's what people remember and cherish.

5. **Only Now:** Life is a series of moments. Don't wait—act now. Kevin Smith’s father lived by the rules and still died screaming. Chase your dreams today.

### Escaping Low Agency Traps

Low agency traps are mental prisons we build ourselves. Here's how to break free:

- **Vague Trap:** Clarify your problems by writing them down or discussing them.
- **Midwit Trap:** Simplify your approach by inverting the problem.
- **Attachment Trap:** Imagine having 10x your current agency—what would you do differently?
- **Rumination Trap:** Turn indecision into action. Treat decisions as experiments.
- **Overwhelm Trap:** Break tasks into manageable steps, just like levels in a video game.

### Turning Bullshit Into Reality

Here's a simple exercise to boost your agency:

1. List your core values.
2. Write down 10 actions that embody these values.
3. Pick the most intimidating action.
4. Break it into micro-steps.
5. Execute immediately.

Feel the rush of becoming a live player in your own life.

### Tools to Boost Your Agency

- **High Agency Flow Chart:** Avoid low agency pitfalls.
- **Swedish House Mafia Technique:** Gather smart friends, lock the door, brainstorm, and act.
- **Story Razor:** Choose the option that makes the best story.
- **Ask For Help:** Clearly define your problem before seeking advice.
- **Perspective Shift:** A new viewpoint can revolutionize your approach.

### Final Thoughts

Remember, there's no perfect time—there's only now. Embrace high agency, challenge norms, and turn your dreams into reality. After all, if Wilbur Wright could fly, what's stopping you?
