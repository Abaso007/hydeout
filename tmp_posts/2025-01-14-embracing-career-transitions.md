### Big Changes on the Horizon

Life's all about change, right? Well, I've got some awesome news to share with you all. I'm making a couple of major shifts in my career that I'm extremely excited about.

First up, I'm leaving Appomni. It's been a great ride, but it's time for me to move on to new adventures. And boy, do I have some cool stuff lined up!

I'm diving headfirst into full-time bug bounty hunting. For those of you who don't know, bug bounty is like being a digital detective. You hunt for security flaws in software and get paid for finding them. It's a hacker's dream job, and I can't wait to dedicate all my time to it.

But that's not all, folks. I'm also taking the plunge into the world of solo entrepreneurship. I'll be working on becoming an AI app builder. The possibilities in this field are endless, and I'm pumped to see what I can create.

Now, here's another cool update. I'm becoming the co-host for the Critical Thinking Bug Bounty podcast! How awesome is that? I'll get to share my experiences, chat with other experts, and hopefully help aspiring bug bounty hunters along the way.

These changes are a big deal for me. They're going to affect my day-to-day life in countless ways. But you know what? I'm ready for the challenge. I've always believed in following your passions and taking risks to achieve your dreams.

So, here's to new beginnings! I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my career. It's going to be a wild ride, but I'm confident it'll be worth it.

Remember, life's too short to stay in your comfort zone. Sometimes, you've got to take that leap of faith. Who knows? You might just land on something awesome.

Stay tuned for more updates as I embark on this new journey. I can't wait to share my experiences with all of you!
