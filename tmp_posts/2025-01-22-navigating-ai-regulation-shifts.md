Trump has just been sworn into office, and one of his first moves is to roll back the AI safety regulations that were put in place by the Biden Administration. Now, I know what you're thinkingâ€”what does this mean for us, especially from a cybersecurity perspective? Let's dive into it.

Under the Biden Administration, there was a landmark Executive Order (web archive link: https://web.archive.org/web/20250112205348/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/) aimed at ensuring America leads in AI innovation while managing its risks. It was a relatively comprehensive strategy that focused on several key areas:

1. **AI Safety and Security**: Developers of powerful AI systems were required to share safety test results with the government. This was all about ensuring AI systems were safe and trustworthy before hitting the public sphere.

2. **Privacy Protection**: With AI's ability to exploit personal data, there were calls for bipartisan data privacy legislation.

3. **Equity and Civil Rights**: The administration aimed to combat algorithmic discrimination and ensure fairness in areas like justice and healthcare.

4. **Consumer Protection**: Efforts were made to advance AI in healthcare and education while protecting consumers from potential AI harms.

5. **Worker Support**: Principles were developed to mitigate AI's impact on jobs and workplace equity.

6. **Innovation and Competition**: The U.S. aimed to maintain its lead in AI innovation by supporting startups and research.

7. **Global Leadership**: Collaborations with international partners were emphasized to ensure safe and responsible AI deployment worldwide.


With Trump in office, these regulations have been rescinded. The new administration seems to be taking a different approach, which, at first glance, might seem like a step backwards. However, it depends what comes next. Trump has announced up to $500 billion in private sector AI infrastructure investment, which could signal a focus on fostering innovation and infrastructure.


From a hacker and cybersecurity lens, this shift raises some concerns. AI safety and security risks can be easily overblown, but ignoring them isn't the answer either. The Biden Administration's focus on AI safety had its flaws, but I personally thought it was a decent start. Now, without these regulations, the question is: what risks does the new administration see as priorities?

Personally, AI safety doesn't concern me in the short term as much as AI security does. The potential for AI to be leveraged in attacks through vulnerabilities like indirect prompt injection, is a real issue that needs attention. Developers need practical advice and recommendations for addressing these security challenges. Long term, I think AI safety is worth prioritizing because there is a day coming when AI systems will be even more influential than they are today.

While the rollback of these regulations might seem alarming, I think we wait and see what comes next. The major point I want to make is that AI will have a significant impact on our lives, and we need people working on both safety and security aspects. The new administration should ideally release something similar to Biden's order or at least provide more practical guidance on security issues.

### List of Practical Changes I'd Like to See
- Suggested gaurdrail software to be used in AI systems (or at least a list of what's out there)
- Easily-deployable templates for AI-cloud infrastructure like what Apple has done for their AI-cloud infrastructure
- A list of poor and proper design patterns for AI systems
- Guides for pentesting and auditing AI systems
- Investment in education for goverment officials and employees on AI security and safety
