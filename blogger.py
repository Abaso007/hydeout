Mental framing can be powerful. Framing is the way you percieve a situation and the story you tell yourself about that situation. It's almost always a "reframe" because our brains jump straight to an initial frame. Reframing a situation in a more positive way is a tactic nearly all emotionally healthy people use.

This post is inspired by Daniel Miessler's [recent post on Framing](https://danielmiessler.com/p/framing-is-everything). It's basically required reading, and this post can be seen as a follow-up to it.

When I think about reframing, I always think about Jocko's [GOOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8), which is similar to the list below.

## List of Reframes

| Situation | Reframing Thought |
|-----------|-------------------|
| My toddler is screaming | In 10 or 20 years, I'd give anything to hear those cries again |
| Standing in the cold | Cold exposure is good for my health |
| Annoyed doing chores | This is an amazing way to serve and love my family |
| Stuck in traffic | More time to listen to an audiobook |
| Feeling overwhelmed by work | I'm really thankful to have a good job |
| Facing criticism | Maybe there's some truth in what they're saying. I can at least use this to self-reflect |
| Experiencing failure | Failure is a necessary part of gaining success. Each misstep could be a valuable lesson |

If you force yourself to mentally reframe things more, you'll almost certainly find yourself more joyful.

For the og:url, the first part of the path where it says "personal" is based on the `categories` section at the top. The rest of the path is based on the file name. the dashes in the date portion change to forward slashes, but the dashes in the name remain. and the .md changes to .html

For the og:title, it should match the title at the top of the blog.

For the og:description should be a short summary sentence of the blog.

The image, it should be the link from the first image in the blog.

The category and tags are in the section at the top.

The options for categories are:
- personal
- ai
- hacking
- cybersecurity

The options for tags are:
- personal
- ai
- hacking
- cybersecurity
- productivity
- art
- faith

You can only choose 1 category, but you can choose multiple tags.
When choosing a category, if it has anything to do with ai or llms, choose ai as i have a slight preference for that type of content.
If it has anything to do with hacking, choose hacking over cybersecurity, but still put cybersecurity as a tag.

Okay, here's the blog for you to process:

BLOG_PROMPT = """Write a blog in markdown about the CONTENT at the bottom of this prompt in my style. Do not use a title heading (single # symbol) in the output as the title will be added manually later. You can use subheadings like ### though and also, you can use numbered or bulleted lists when necessary.
Here's some writing tips:
**I. General Writing Philosophy and Approach**

*   **Embrace Individuality:** There's room for every writing style, interest, and personality type.  Don't feel constrained by prescribed rules.
*   **Strive for Excellence:** While style can vary, the quality of writing must be exceptionally high.
*   **Engage with Readers, Not Just Trends:** Don't chase fleeting trends ("dopamine culture"). Focus on building a lasting relationship with readers through substantive, high-quality work. This means going beyond short-form, attention-grabbing content.
*   **Values-Driven Writing:** Align your writing with your personal values. Don't compromise your principles to chase popularity.
*   **Storytelling is Key (But Define It):**  "Storytelling" is a buzzword, but its core is about creating stakes, making readers root for (or fear) an outcome, and wanting to see how things resolve.
*   **Stories Fit the Brain:** Human brains are wired for stories. Information presented in a narrative format is more memorable than facts or statistics alone.
*   **Note-Taking is Crucial:**  Extensive, physical note-taking is valuable. Use a spiral notebook that lies flat, allows for ripping out pages, and has good paper quality.  Don't be precious about completed notebooks; the process of taking and manipulating notes is key.
*   **Be Yourself:**  Infuse your writing with your authentic personality. Don't be afraid to be different, even if it means losing some potential audience members.  A strong brand is defined by who you're *not* for, as well as who you are for.
*   **Playfulness:** Writing should be playful. This brings out your personality and prevents the work from becoming too serious.  Experiment with language and structure.
*   **Writing is Thinking:** Writing is a tool for clarifying your thoughts.  It helps you distill ideas to their essence.
*   **Writing *and* Design:** Copy and design are intertwined.  Visual presentation (layout, images, typography) significantly impacts the effectiveness of written communication. Write *in* the intended medium (e.g., write a newsletter *in* the newsletter software).
*   **Iterative Process:** Embrace rewriting and editing. Don't expect to get it perfect on the first draft.  The best writing often emerges through multiple iterations. Get feedback, test variations, and refine.
*   **Inspiration from Everywhere:** Draw inspiration from diverse sources (e.g., tweets, advertisements, other writers, speeches).  Observe how others communicate effectively and adapt those techniques.
*   Writing helps with public speaking and pitching.
*   Find what is working and go aggressively after it.
*   **Don't judge ideas too early**.

**II. Specific Writing Techniques and Devices**

*   **Diacope (The "Verbal Sandwich"):**  Repeating a word or phrase with a few words in between (e.g., "Free at last, free at last," "Bond, James Bond"). This creates memorable phrases.
*   **Chiasmus (The Reversal):** Saying something and then saying it in reverse (e.g., "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"). This creates symmetry and a sense of truth.
*   **Epistrophe:**  Repeating the same word or phrase at the end of successive clauses or sentences (e.g., "Yes we can").  Effective in speeches and persuasive writing.
*   **Anaphora:** Repeating the same word of phrase at the *beginning* of phrases.
*   **Show, Don't Tell (Sensory Details):** Instead of stating facts, describe what a character would *see, hear, smell, taste, and feel*. Focus on concrete details, especially those a child might notice.
*   **Build Layers of Meaning:** Use word choice, tone, and tempo to suggest deeper emotional truths and contextual information beyond the surface-level events.
*   **First Draft for You, Editing for the Reader:** Write the first draft freely, without self-censorship.  Then, edit ruthlessly from the reader's perspective, removing redundancies, clichés, and anything that doesn't serve the story.
*   **Lean Writing:**  Strive for a "pure economy of elements."  Remove anything that doesn't directly contribute to the story and its language.
*   **Intriguing Openings:** Start with a line that injects a question into the reader's mind without explicitly asking a question.  Create a sense of mystery.
*   **Punchy Endings:** End paragraphs with a short, impactful sentence that summarizes the point and provides a sense of closure.
*   **Framing:**  Establish a relatable analogy or metaphor to make your point more persuasive (e.g., framing software-as-a-service as a landlord-tenant relationship).
*   **Alliteration and Assonance:**  Use words that start with the same letter (alliteration) or have similar vowel sounds (assonance) for rhythmic effect, especially when emphasizing a point.
*   **Vary Sentence Length and Structure:**  Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones.  Use occasional multi-syllable words for emphasis.
*   **Interrupt the Cadence:**  Break up the flow of your writing with unexpected elements (e.g., humor, personal anecdotes, emotional moments, images) to create tension and keep the reader engaged.
*   **Contrast:** If you have a predominant style, use the opposite style to emphasize certain points.
*   **"Enchanted Words":** Use words that evoke positive emotions and a sense of wonder when describing positive aspects of your topic.
*   **Closing the Loop:** Refer back to earlier points in your writing to create a sense of connection and completeness.
*   **The Rule of Three (Comedy):**  In a list of three, the first two items are similar, and the third breaks the pattern for comedic effect.
*   **Repetition for Rhythm:** Repeat key words or phrases for emphasis and to create a rhythmic flow.
*   **Parallelism:**  Use similar grammatical structures for corresponding elements in a list or comparison to create symmetry and clarity.
*   **Bold Text:**  Use bold text to highlight key phrases and create visual emphasis.
*   **Visual Aids:** Incorporate illustrations or images to complement and enhance your written message.
*   **Get Feedback:** Share your work with trusted readers to get feedback and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Embrace the Messy Process:** The creative process is often non-linear.  Don't be afraid to experiment, make mistakes, and revise.
*   **Theme:** Every detail should relate back to the overarching theme of the story.
*   **Surprise:** Include turning points and unexpected events to keep the reader engaged.
*   **Relatability:** Connect with the reader by incorporating emotions and experiences that are universally relatable.
*   **Particulars and Universals:** Combine specific, vivid details with universal themes and emotions.
*   **Anglo-Saxon vs. Latinate Words:** Be aware of the different connotations of words derived from Anglo-Saxon (more direct, earthy) and Latin (more formal, sophisticated) roots.
*   **Sentence Structure (Predication):**
    *   **Front-Loaded:**  Subject and verb are at the beginning, followed by modifiers. Creates immediate impact.
    *   **Delayed Predication:** Modifiers come first, delaying the subject and verb. Creates suspense.
    *   **Split Predication:**  Subject comes first, followed by modifiers, then the verb.  Rarer, but can create suspense or comedy.
    *   Varying sentence structure within a paragraph creates rhythm and interest.
* Evocative statements.
*   **Find the Essence:**  Distill your message to its core elements. A good pitch or explanation should be clear and concise.
*   **Contrast two choices.**

**III. Story Structure**

*   **Stakes:** Clearly define what's at stake for the character.  Even in seemingly mundane stories, stakes can be emotional (e.g., embarrassment, ego).
*   **5-Second Moment of Change:**  Every good story revolves around a pivotal moment where the character undergoes a transformation. The ending is often the opposite of the beginning.
*   **Tension and Obstacle:** Stories involve tension and obstacles that the character must overcome.
*   **Don't Tell Vacation Stories:** Avoid stories that are simply about pleasant experiences. Focus on moments of change and conflict.
*   **Establish, Then Transform:** In persuasive writing (like a product launch), first establish the current reality (and its problems), then present your solution as a transformation of that reality. Get the reader to agree with your assessment of the problem before introducing your solution.
*   **Product Demo Structure:** Similar to persuasive writing, a good product demo often shows the problems with existing solutions before presenting the new product as a better alternative.
* Build the story piece by piece.

Here's my writing style:
1. Calm, direct tone - Your writing uses a neutral calm tone that isn't formal as if you are having a conversation with the reader. 

2. Personal anecdotes and experiences (only when appropriate) - You share personal stories and experiences from your own life to illustrate your points. This makes your writing relatable. (you don't have this context so if you think the text needs one, put [personal anecdote about <topic> here])

3. Numbered lists and headers - You organize information into numbered lists and use descriptive headers to break up content and make it easy to scan and digest. This provides a clear structure.

4. Short paragraphs - Most of your paragraphs are quite short, often only 3-4 sentences. This allows readers to quickly move through the content without getting bogged down.

5. Advice-oriented - Much of your writing aims to provide concrete tips and advice to the reader on topics like cybersecurity, hacking, and parenting. You focus on actionable insights.

6. Occasional humor and wit - While much of your writing is straightforward, you sprinkle in moments of humor and witty observations. 

7. Technical jargon balanced with explanations - As a hacker, you use some technical terminology, but you make an effort to explain it for a general audience.

8. Motivational messages - Some of your writing aims to encourage and motivate the reader, like telling parents "thank you for deciding to be parents" or pushing cybersecurity practices. You connect personally with readers.

9. Concise and focused - You tend to get to the point quickly without unnecessary fluff or digressions. Each post has a clear focus that you adhere to from start to finish. Your writing is efficient.

Most common adjectives:
1. good
2. great
3. awesome
4. best
5. cool

1. extremely
2. quickly
