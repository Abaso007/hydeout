**Joseph Thacker (rez0)**

I'm a Christian, husband, father, hacker, and cybersecurity professional.
I love most things in life, but I'm particularly fond of hacking, ai-art, running, podcasts, and keylime pie.

I'm security researcher who specializes on application security and AI. Iâ€™ve helped Fortune 500 companies close vulnerabilities that could have cost them millions in lawsuits or loss of trust. I've submitted or collaborated on over 1,000 vulnerabilities across Hackerone and Bugcrowd. Companies and developers make the same mistakes over and over. I love helping solve those issues whether it's via hacking, teaching, and consulting. Reach out to my email down below  if you'd like my help!
