**Joseph Thacker (rez0)**

I'm a Principal AI Engineer at AppOmni as well as a security researcher who specializes in application security and AI. Iâ€™ve helped Fortune 500 companies find vulnerabilities that could have cost them millions, and I've submitted over 1,000 vulnerabilities across Hackerone and Bugcrowd. I love helping secure the planet by building and breaking systems.  Reach out if you'd like to know more.
   
On a more personal level, I'm a Christian, husband, father, and hacker.
I love most things in life, but I'm particularly fond of hacking, ai-art, running, podcasts, and keylime pie.
