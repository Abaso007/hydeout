**Joseph Thacker (rez0)**

I'm a Christian, husband, father, hacker, and cybersecurity professional.
I love most things in life, but I'm particularly fond of hacking, ai-art, running, podcasts, and keylime pie.

Through the transition from software engineer to security analyst to security engineer to security researcher who specializes on appsec and AI, I've come to understand the security industry at a pretty deep level. During that time, I've submitted or collaborated on over 1,000 vulnerabilities across Hackerone and Bugcrowd. There are tons of take-aways and common issues. 

I love helping solve those issues whether it's via hacking, teaching, and consulting. Reach out to my email down below anytime if you'd like my help!
