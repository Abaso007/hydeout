A tool that opens multiple reconnaissance tabs for a domain. Simply enter a domain name (like example.com) and the tool will launch searches across multiple platforms to gather intelligence about the target.

This tool helps automate the initial reconnaissance phase of bug hunting by opening tabs for Google, GitHub, Wayback Machine, Shodan, SecurityTrails, crt.sh, ChatGPT, and Censys searches.
