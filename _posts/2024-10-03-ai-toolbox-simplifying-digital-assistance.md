He's right. I talk to people about AI every day, and most don't realize all the ways they could use it. I've had an idea for an app for a long time. This post is putting it out in the world so someone else will build it.

### The Concept: Profession-Based AI Dashboards

I think LLMs will continue to revolutionize many industries and professions. However:

- Not everyone is creative enough to come up with prompts
- It takes time to write out or copy-paste prompts
- Interfaces matter A LOT (e.g., GPT-3 vs. ChatGPT)

I've long thought that an ideal interface would feature profession-based "dashboards" of the most useful prompts for that profession or hobby. 

Here are some examples:

**Hacker's Toolbox**
- Make a bash script for...
- Convert this GET to POST
- Convert this JSON POST to URL Encoded Form
- Give me 10 obfuscations for this XSS payload

**Writer's Toolbox**
- Antonym
- Synonym
- Finish this sentence
- 5 random ideas
- 5 random characters
- Give me a chapter outline based on this summary of events

**Developer's Toolbox**
- Explain this error message
- Comment this code

**High School Science Teacher's Toolbox**
- Give me a cheesy science joke
- Give me a random astronomy fact
- Give me 10 example quiz questions

For some profession's like developers, custom apps like Cursor are probably much better. This is just to express the idea. I'm sure you can think of many other great examples.

### Why It's An Awesome Idea

1. It takes an esoteric, creativity-required tool and gives 80% of the benefit to people who might not have the creativity or time to craft prompts.
2. In today's world, barrier to entry is everything. This makes the barrier to entry near zero.
3. The app can be community-driven:
   - Users can upvote and downvote the most/least useful prompts for their professions
   - Users can submit new prompts

Thanks for reading! So, who's building this?
