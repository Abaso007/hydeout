George Mack just released a new essay called [High Agency](https://highagency.com). I had seen him on the Chris Williamson podcast before, but he went deeper down the rabbit hole and released this nice essay about it. Shout out to [archangel](https://x.com/ArchAngelDDay) for the recommendation to read it. 

In bug bounty, high agency is a super powerful weapon. Bug bounty is not just about finding vulnerabilities. It's also about navigating the entire process with a high agency mindset. 

#### High Agency Recon

1. **Ask for More Scope:** Maybe you don't settle for the initial scope provided. Reach out to program owners and ask if there are additional areas you can explore. More scope means more opportunities.

2. **Request Additional Credentials:** Oftentimes, having more access can lead to discovering more bugs. Politely ask if you can get additional credentials to other systems when you get the chance.

3. **Read the docs:** Most hunters are not reading the docs. But if you do, you'll have a huge advantage.

#### High Agency Reporting

1. **Tactful Pushback:** If you receive a lower payout than expected, calmly ask for clarification on the severity. Understanding their perspective can help you make a case for a higher reward or at least feel less upset about the payout. If you believe your finding deserves more, present additional evidence or comparisons to similar bugs that received higher payouts. Be respectful but firm.

2. **High Quality Reports:** If you write a report that clearly demonstrates the impact and include remediation steps, you'll be much more likely to get a higher payout.

3. **Seek Feedback:** On your first few submitted reports, ask for feedback on how you can improve your reports in the future.

#### High Agency Networking

1. **Ask for +1s:** Don't hesitate to ask your hacker friends for +1s to events. 

2. **Request Invites from Program Owners:** If there's a live hacking event being held by a company you hack on a lot, reach out to the program owners in one of your reports. Express your interest and ask if they can extend an invitation.

### Wrapping Up

High agency in bug bounty is about influencing outcomes to your favor. It's about asking the right questions, seeking opportunities, and gently pushing back when necessary. Hopefully this essay inspires you to be a bit higher agency in your hacking.
