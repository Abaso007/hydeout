A "hackbot" is the term I've settled on using for talking about AI systems hacking abilities. I saw the term in the title of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o7qYHO0psI) from Blackhat 2023.

In a [previous post](https://josephthacker.com/ai/2023/11/08/ai-hacking-agents.html), I covered why I think hackbots will outperform humans. This post will be a comprehensive discussion on hackbots. What nuances do I imply when I use that term? What capabilities do they have? Do they already exist? Etc.

### Hackbot Defined
I define "hackbot" as any automated system using AI in a substantial way with the ability to find vulnerabilities in hardened production applications (such as those with bug bounty programs). Almost all hackbots today are much more than a simple LLM. They are advanced systems which have different harnesses and/or states where traditional code, existing tools, fuzzers, etc. are used to find vulnerabilities. 

AI in these systems might be used for:
- Selecting which tool to run
- Selecting which configurations to set for specific tools
- Choosing which wordlists to use
- Guiding the system for which features to hack on
- Knowing which requests or parameters should be tested
- Picking which payloads should be used for testing
- Knowing whether the attacks were successful
- Writing the reports
- Any other things

### Why Do You Care?
The hackbot industry is fascinating and relatively mind-blowing for me for a few reasons:
- If humanity can build a decent hackbot, we could spin up thousands of them and find a massive percentage of vulnerabilities on the internet. That would help us secure things in a big way.
- If a company can create a hackbot that can find bounties on bug bounty programs reliably, it's basically a free-money machine until all the bugs it can find are gone.
- If a nation-state has a highly competent hackbot, that's a real issue, especially if the U.S. doesn't have good relations with them. 

### Current Hackbots
I believe there are many variations on hackbots out there. Most of them are likely in stealth or being developed by government agencies.

The four companies I'm aware of are:
- [Ethiack](https://ethiack.com/)
- [Sybil](https://www.runsybil.com/) (or RubSybil?)
- [Aiko](https://aikocorp.ai)
- [Staris](https://www.staris.tech/)

I know a bit about each one except Sybil, and I can say that the other three are completely different from one another. They're tackling the problem from different angles. They have different expertise.

I'm really stoked about the future of hackbots.

### rez0's Dreams For The Future
I have a few hopes and dreams for the hackbot industry that I want to put out into the world. 
- Dear OpenAI and other foundation model makers, please don't nerf security expertise in your models. GPT4 is already denying me a good amount when using it for hacking.
