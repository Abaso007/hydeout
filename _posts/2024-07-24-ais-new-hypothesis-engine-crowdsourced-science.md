AI's capability to generate high-quality ideas is comparable to, or even better than, that of most intelligent humans. When prompted for open public participation ideas, Claude3.5 suggested the 'Collective Scientific Hypothesis Engine': an open platform allowing anyone to propose hypotheses, design experiments, contribute data, and collaborate with the scientific community and citizen scientists. Machine learning algorithms synthesize user inputs to generate testable predictions, while reputation systems and peer review ensure quality. This is indeed a brilliant idea!
