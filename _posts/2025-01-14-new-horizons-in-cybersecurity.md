### Big Changes on the Horizon

Hey folks, I've got some awesome news to share with you all. Life's all about change, right? Well, I'm making a couple of major shifts in my career that I'm extremely excited about.

First off, I'm leaving Appomni. It's been a great ride, but it's time for new adventures. And boy, do I have some cool stuff lined up!

I'm diving headfirst into the world of full-time bug bounty hunting. For those of you who don't know, bug bounty is like being a digital detective. You hunt for security flaws in software and get paid for finding them. It's a hacker's dream come true!

But that's not all. I'm also taking the plunge as a solo founder and entrepreneur. I've got some exciting ideas brewing, particularly in the realm of AI app building. The possibilities in this field are just mind-blowing, and I can't wait to see what I can create.

### Stepping into the Podcast World

Now, here's another cool update. I'm becoming the co-host for the Critical Thinking Bug Bounty podcast! How awesome is that?

This is a great opportunity to share my experiences, insights, and maybe even a few hacking war stories with the community. Plus, I get to geek out about cybersecurity with like-minded folks. It's a win-win!

I'm looking forward to diving deep into topics like:

1. The latest trends in bug bounty hunting
2. Tips and tricks for aspiring hackers (the ethical kind, of course!)
3. The impact of AI on cybersecurity
4. How to think critically when approaching security challenges

These changes are a big deal for me, and I'm pumped to see where they lead. It's going to be a wild ride, but I'm ready for it.

Remember, life's too short to stay in your comfort zone. Sometimes you've got to take that leap and see where you land. Who knows? You might just fly.

Stay tuned for more updates as I embark on this new chapter. It's going to be an interesting journey, and I can't wait to share it with you all!
