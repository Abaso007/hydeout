Today is Day 1. 

Day 1 of what? Read on and find out. 

Some people are motivated by a metric they want to hit, or a thing they want to by, or a person they want to impress.

I've realized that I'm motivated by visualizing who I want to be. In college, I got so excited about the idea of being a Christian coder--developing software while jamming to Christian worship music--so I worked hard and made it happen. During my 5 years of software engineering, I realized I was more passionate about cybersecurity. I wanted to be an awesome hacker. I started with that image as the dream, but quickly realized how cool bug bounty and their live events were. So it changed to be a more specific dream of wanting to be an awesome bug bounty hunter who went to live hacking events--someone who got paid to hack Fortune 100 companies. So... I worked hard and made it happen. 

Since then, it took me awhile to see it, but it's been difficult to know what the next big dream is. I've pursued a bunch of things sort-of randomly without having a clear vision of who I wanted to become (at least in a professional sense). In some ways, I think I stumbled into huge parts of the "next dream". If you follow my posts at all, you know I'm obsessed with AI. Due to constantly learning I found myself ahead of the game in how to build and break AI systems. So much so that at work I pivoted into a Principal AI Engineering role, and I now help build AppOmni's SaaS Security AI assistant. I'm still going to be doing that. This blog is about what I plan to do with my side-hustle time.

So yeah, clearly I love building. In the last year and a half I have built:
- a "write in your style" app called rezonate (basically ready to ship)
- an ai application pentesting business launched with rhynorater || wehack.ai (dormant)
- an app that will write and format blog posts for me (works fine, just not blogging much)
- a Christian mentor AI chatbot (was prod-ready, but I didn't ship it)
- a whatsapp bot for bringing ai access to illiterate 3rd world people groups (still pretty alpha)
- a STT app that uses multimodal gemini flash and is much better than other TTS out there (very alpha)
- an ebook-to-audiobook TTS project that a friend and I are using to make audio books from web serials (not shippable)
- a stealth project in the "using ai to hack" space
- an AI consulting business || rez0corp.com (taking clients)

And I consume a ton of business content from people like Alex Hormozi, Greg Isenberg, @levelsio, etc. Based on much of that content, I personally think the holy grail is bootstrapped b2c SaaS. The tough part is that it requires a lot of skills, reach, and hard work. Besides my building skills above, I've had a ton of success in bug bounty hacking, and even AI security/safety testing. Being so deep in those two things is a high leverage skillset. As for reach, the best way is to build an audience by providing real value. I've been doing that for years. It's led to a pretty large following on X (52k followers), my email list (2000+ subscribers), my blog, linkedin, and even a few hundred on youtube. Of course I'm down for hard work. I love doing hard things. And I fundamentally believe there's massive new markets available due to the new paradigms that AI models bring. 

So all of that boils doing to why I've convegred on this dream: I want to build an awesome b2c ai-based SaaS app. And sure, I'll still be available for AI consulting, pentests, and bug bounty when those float to the surface. But the journey I'm inviting you to follow me on is this:
**Building a game-changing AI SaaS app empire by providing insane value**

One key part of all this is that my plan is to build in public, sharing my journey and experiences as I go. Initially, I'm not sure where it'll lead me and I'm not sure what idea to start with. If you have thoughts, hit me up on X (rez0__) or discord (rez0). I may work on multiple ideas at first, but will commit to one within the first few months and focus on it after that.
