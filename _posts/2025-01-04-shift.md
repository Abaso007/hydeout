In most domains, the best AI tools of our day reduce friction and speed up top-tier humans. Agents might take over later, but for now, applications like [Cursor](https://cursor.com) showcase the most effective usage of generative AI. 

That's why Justin([@rhynorater](https://x.com/rhynorater)) and I built [Shift](https://shiftplugin.com).

Shift is an AI-powered plugin for [Caido](https://caido.io/), the web proxy, which will transform how you hack. Think of it as a Copilot for web application testing - it can automate actions while you work, effectively letting you stay in a hacking flow state.


  
Shift is one of the first tools of its kind. Instead of memorizing complex syntax for regex or digging through documentation for HTTPQL, you can control Caido using simple commands. Need to generate a context-aware wordlist for your target application? Just ask. Want to create match & replace rules to modify requests on the fly? Shift handles it seamlessly.

The plugin is built with customization in mind. You can tailor it to your specific needs with custom memory, instructions, and tab-naming logic. This flexibility means Shift adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.

As someone who's spent countless hours both hacking and working with AI (including winning Google's LLM Bugswat), I can confidently say that Shift represents the idea way for using AI to hack. Together with Justin, we've created a tool that genuinely saves us hours of time each month.

To get started, [go to the website](https://shiftplugin.com) and sign up. For the next 20 people who sign up, we're offering a 50% discount on the first month by using code `SHIFTLAUNCH`. Here's a small demo as well:
