_Bringing clarity to questions about Prompt Injection Security_

Everyone loves talking about prompt injection, but the real impact to an application is often hard to understand. 

So, I wrote a guide to make it clear where the risk is, what an attack would look like, and suggestions on how to mitigate the risk. There are two links below. The first is the Github Repo. If it's useful, I'd love if you starred it and put in a pull request for any suggested changes. The second is the PDF link which is better for printing and some people find it easier to read.

Github Repo: [https://github.com/jthack/PIPE](https://github.com/jthack/PIPE)

PDF Link: [https://github.com/jthack/PIPE/blob/main/pipe.pdf](https://github.com/jthack/PIPE/blob/main/pipe.pdf)

Please check it out, share it, and [give me feedback](https://twitter.com/rez0__) if you have any!
