_Bringing clarity to questions about Prompt Injection Security_

Everyone loves talking about prompt injection, but the real impact to an application is often hard to understand. 

So, I wrote a guide to make it clear:
- Where is the risk?
- What would an attack would look like?
- How can it be prevented?

There are two links to it below. The first is the Github Repo. If it's useful, I'd love if you starred it and put in a pull request for any suggested changes. The second is the PDF link which is better for printing and some people find it easier to read.

**Github Repo:** [https://github.com/jthack/PIPE](https://github.com/jthack/PIPE)

**PDF Link:** [https://rez0.blog/assets/pipe.pdf](https://rez0.blog/assets/pipe.pdf) (also in the Github repo)

Please check it out, share it, and [give me feedback](https://twitter.com/rez0__) if you have any!
