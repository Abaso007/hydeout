Mental framing is powerful. Framing is the way you percieve a situation and the story you tell yourself about that situation. This post is a list of helpful framing examples from my life.

This post is inspired by Daniel Miessler's [recent post on Framing](https://danielmiessler.com/p/framing-is-everything). It's basically required reading, and this post can be seen as a follow-up to it.

### Big List of Reframes
when my toddler is screaming and im stressed out, i remind myself that in 10 years (and especially in 20 years), i'd give all my money to hear those screams again
when i'm standing in the cold, i reframe and think about how cold exposure is good for me.
when im annoyed i need to do dishes and laundry, i tell myself that i'm serving my family and my wife by doing those things, and that service is a form of love and care that strengthens our bonds and the fabric of our daily lives.
when I'm stuck in traffic, I consider it an opportunity to listen to my favorite music or an audiobook, turning a frustrating delay into a moment of personal enrichment and calm.
when I feel overwhelmed by work, I remind myself that each task completed is a step towards my goals and a testament to my dedication and ability to overcome challenges.
when I encounter setbacks, I view them as chances to learn and grow, transforming obstacles into stepping stones toward success and resilience.
when I face criticism, I see it as feedback that can help me improve and refine my approach, converting negative comments into constructive lessons for personal and professional development.
when I experience failure, I understand it as a necessary part of the journey to achievement, treating each misstep as a valuable lesson that paves the way for future triumphs.

Here's the information formatted as a markdown table:
