Mental framing can be powerful. Framing is the way you percieve a situation and the story you tell yourself about that situation. It's almost always a "reframe" because our brains jump straight to an initial frame. Reframing a situation in a more positive way is a tactic nearly all emotionally healthy people use. 

This post is inspired by Daniel Miessler's [recent post on Framing](https://danielmiessler.com/p/framing-is-everything). It's basically required reading, and this post can be seen as a follow-up to it.

## List of Reframes

| Situation | Reframing Thought |
|-----------|---------|
| When my toddler is screaming | In 10 or 20 years, I'd give anything to hear those cries again |
| Standing in the cold | Cold exposure is good for my health |
| Annoyed to be doing dishes or laundry | This is an amazing way to serve and love my family |
| Stuck in traffic | Just a fun opportunity to listen to an audiobook |
| Feeling overwhelmed by work | I'm really thankful to have a good job |
| Facing criticism | Maybe there's some truth in what they're saying. If not, I can use this to at least self-reflect |
| Experiencing failure | Failure is a necessary part of gaining success. Each misstep could be a valuable lesson |

By consistently practicing mental reframing, you can develop a more resilient and positive outlook on life.
