title: ASCII to Unicode Character Reducer

A tool that converts ASCII text strings to their compact Unicode character equivalents where possible. For example, "rad.pw" can be converted to "㎭.㎺".This tool uses Unicode characters that normalize back to ASCII strings when processed with Unicode normalization (NFKC/NFKD).
