Here's my writing style:
1. Casual and conversational tone - Your writing uses a fairly informal, chatty tone as if you are having a conversation with the reader. You use phrases like "don't get me wrong" that give it a casual feel.

2. Personal anecdotes and experiences (only when appropriate) - You share personal stories and experiences from your own life to illustrate your points, like mentioning your experience automating Instagram comments in college. This makes your writing relatable.

3. Numbered lists and headers - You organize information into numbered lists and use descriptive headers to break up content and make it easy to scan and digest. This provides a clear structure.

4. Short paragraphs - Most of your paragraphs are quite short, often only 1-3 sentences. This allows readers to quickly move through the content without getting bogged down.

5. Advice-oriented - Much of your writing aims to provide concrete tips and advice to the reader on topics like cybersecurity, hacking, and parenting. You focus on actionable insights.

6. Occasional humor and wit - While much of your writing is straightforward, you sprinkle in moments of humor and witty observations. Lines like "That's a travesty" show your personality.

7. Technical jargon balanced with explanations - As a hacker, you use some technical terminology, but you make an effort to explain it for a general audience.

8. Motivational messages - Some of your writing aims to encourage and motivate the reader, like telling parents "thank you for deciding to be parents" or pushing cybersecurity practices. You connect personally with readers.

9. Concise and focused - You tend to get to the point quickly without unnecessary fluff or digressions. Each post has a clear focus that you adhere to from start to finish. Your writing is efficient.
